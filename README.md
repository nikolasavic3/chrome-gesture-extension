# Privacy Policy for YouTube Gesture Control Extension

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how the YouTube Gesture Control extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect
The YouTube Gesture Control extension accesses your webcam to detect hand gestures that control YouTube video playback. Specifically:

1. **Camera Feed**: The extension processes your webcam video feed locally on your device to detect hand gestures (open palm and closed fist).
2. **User Preferences**: We store your preference for whether gesture control is enabled or disabled using Chrome's storage API.

## How We Use Your Information
- **Camera Feed**: All webcam processing happens entirely on your device. No video or image data is transmitted to any external servers.
- **User Preferences**: Your preference settings are stored locally in your browser and are only used to remember whether you want gesture control to be active.

## Data Storage and Security
- All video processing happens locally on your device.
- No video data, images, or recognition results are transmitted to any external servers.
- No personal information is collected, stored, or shared.

## Third-Party Services
The extension uses the MediaPipe library (provided by Google) to perform hand gesture recognition. This library is loaded from Google's CDN but processes all data locally on your device.

## Your Rights
You can disable camera access at any time through your browser settings or by disabling the extension.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
